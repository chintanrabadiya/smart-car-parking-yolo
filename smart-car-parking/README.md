<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

_link to video output, please refer to the [Youtube](https://youtu.be/B0EuijnaCqU)_

There are many great car parking lot detection projects available on GitHub, however I didn<t find that really suit my needs so I created this enhenced one. I want to create project that will  will be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Yolov5 is used for detection of object in this project which is very fast so we can use it for real time detection of parking lot.
* Yolov5 is already trained and available in various version, we can choose version according to computation resourses available

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
* [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
